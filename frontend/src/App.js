    // What is DOM? Document Object model
    // represents the structure of a webpage as a tree of objects
    // every element in an HTML document becomes a node in this tree.
    // DOM allows JS or React to interact, modify and manipulate the structure of the webpage
    // dynamically
    // With React, Virtual DOM is used which is a lightweight copy of the DOM.
    // React updates the part of the DOM that changes, instead of re-rendering the entire DOM tree
    // React finds the diff and also batches updates from the virtual DOM, reducing re-renders
    // reduces reflows (layout recalculations) and repaints (redrawing elements) as a result of fewer re-renders
    // Also virtual DOM is in memory so it is faster to manipulate.
    // Lets developers focus on UI while React hanldes efficient updates.
